# Omnipay: Laybuy

## DNA Design NOTES:
This fork was created to make the module compatible with omnipay 3 for the tyrehub shop.
Only payments have been tested. Refund and cancellation were not tested.
Unit test haven't been updated.
Tight budget and time constraint prevent us from making the module usable by anyone.

If you are not a DNA Design employee, use at your own risk.

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/mediabeastnz/omnipay-laybuy/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/mediabeastnz/omnipay-laybuy)

[Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay) is a framework agnostic, multi-gateway payment
processing library for PHP 5.3+. This package implements PayPal support for Omnipay.

## Installation

Omnipay is installed via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). To install, simply add it
to your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "mediabeastnz/omnipay-laybuy": "~2.0"
    }
}
```

And run composer to update your dependencies:

    $ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ php composer.phar update

For general usage instructions, please see the main [Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay)
repository.

## Quirks

Laybuy purchase requests require many fields so be sure to check what fields you'll need to pass through e.g customers phone. Refunds require an orderId so this will need to be stored if you wish to process refunds later.
